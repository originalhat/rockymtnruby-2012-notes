### Go Ahead, Make a Mess

- using OO to clean up messes
- public and private APIs
- "design happens from the message-senders' point of view"

### Refactoring from Good to Great

- "a smell is not a problem-- it's an indicator of what might be a problem"

      class DateRange < Struct.new(:start_date, :end_date)
      end

- "Let's write the code we wish we had…"
- "Most people err on the side of being too unwilling to extract classes… lots of tiny classes-- that's the sign of a good object-oriented system."
- post-refactor: "what every programmer's favorite part of their job?" audience: "DELETING CODE!"
